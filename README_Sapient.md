The following approached I followed.

Modular Approach: 
I made each component a granular approach. e.g Each route has its own screen.
The table has a separate component.
Table row has a separate component.
The chart has a separate Component.
ALl the parent is kept under the container folder.
All the granular components are kept in the component folder.
the components are responsive. Including tablets and mobile.

Functionalities achieved:
The data are API driven and dynamic.
the Table is fed with the data which is coming from API and getting generated.
the previous and next button after the data points won't through error: that is taken care of
changing the table with pagination.
charts are only driven by data presently on the table. it is not static.
test cases are written for 4 components.
The upvote is stored in local storage with their corresponding id.
the upvote is getting increased and you can see it in the view with each corresponding upvote click.
